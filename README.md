# C# and .NET Framework Projects
## Introduction
This repository contains my C# and .NET Framework coding projects for the Web Design and Software Development Diploma Course.
The repository contains projects that showcase the development of my skills in the use of the C# programming language in conjunction with the .NET Framework in order to build the back-end of web applications.
The content is intended  for my course instructors first and foremost and then anyone who might be interested in the sort of work I'm doing.
## Technologies
C# is a programming language that can be used to create complex and robust software programs, capable of satisfying the needs of large businesses.
The .NET Framework is a collection of tools and pre-made software that help developers make computer programs.
These are the two main technologies addressed in this repository
## Projects
I will be summarising the projects  as I gradually build the repository.
## Contact
All comments and improvement suggestions for the projects are welcome.
I can be contacted on my email <knhunduru@hotmail.com> for any comments and/or suggestions
